## 🗣️ Everything is made entirely in Astro.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of the project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

 The physics of the project may not be entirely accurate due to certain approximations, simplifications, practical limitations inherent in its design or due to my lack of understanding of the subject.
 However, the philosophy driving the project is unwaveringly accurate and deeply rooted in its purpose.



## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
